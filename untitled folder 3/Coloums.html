          They're unusual in legal documents, but I don't object to <i> columns </i> in a long document like a CONTRACT or a settlement agreement. Columns are an easy way to get a shorter and more legible LINE LENGTH without using large PAGE MARGINS. On a standard 8.5" x 11"s page, two or three columns are fine. Four is too many.</p>
         <p class="endcoloumn2">
        Usually columns look neatest when the rows of text are aligned vertically between columns (i.e., as if they were sitting on the same baseline). Look at a decent newspaper for an example. Getting this result takes a little extra effort. Note your LINE SPACING and make sure any SPACE BETWEEN PARAGRAPHS works out to a whole multiple of the line spacing. The two most common options: set space between paragraphs to zero, or set it to be the same as the line spacing.</p>
